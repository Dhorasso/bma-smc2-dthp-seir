## Bayesian Model Averaging usin SMC^2

This repository contains the implementation code of the paper **"An ensemble approach to epidemic modeling: Integrating Hawkes process and SIR model"**.
The project introduces a novel framework that combines discrete-time Hawkes processes (DTHP) and Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models for improved epidemic tracking and forecasting.
